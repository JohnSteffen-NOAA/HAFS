sbatch jobcard_atm_prep.sh 

Note: Tasks C, D, and E can be run concurrently
C. Run the ocn_prep job to generate ocean initial condition and forcings
sbatch jobcard_ocn_prep.sh
D. Run the atm_ic job to generate atmosphere initial conditions
sbatch jobcard_atm_ic.sh
E. Run the atm_lbc job to generate atmosphere lateral boundary conditions
sbatch jobcard_atm_lbc.sh

Note: Tasks F, G, H, and I can be run concurrently
F. Run the forecast job
sbatch jobcard_forecast.sh jobcard_atm_post.sh jobcard_ocn_post.sh jobcard_product.sh
G. Run the atm_post job
